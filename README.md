> *‚ÄúAn Armband which can make a difference in the lives of people.‚Äù*

Mostly the spread of covid 19 has been noted as being through air and contact. The fact that this can be used combat any form of disease that require the entry to human body through the open orifices on the face i.e mouth,nose,ears etc makes this product highly marketable.

Since each and every human being throughout the world has been advised to follow the social norms but the most important factor is the safety of ourselves first. Even though people are asked to maintain the social distance, a few follow them but the prior **motive is to take care of yourself in every possible manner**.

> *Your safety is the first and foremost priority*

### üìç What and Why?

<details>
<summary><sup><em>Know the working of EMG</em></sup></summary>
<p>
  
  - The EMG signal that is captured  is a biomedical signal that measures electrical currents generated in muscles during its contraction representing neuromuscular activities.
  - When EMG is acquired from electrodes mounted directly on the skin, the signal is a composite of all the muscle fiber action potentials occurring in the muscles underlying the skin. These action potentials occur at random intervals. 
  - So at any one moment, the EMG signal may be either positive or negative voltage. Individual muscle fiber action potentials are sometimes acquired using wire or needle electrodes placed directly in the muscle. 
  - The amplitude range of EMG signal is 0-10 mV (+5 to -5) prior to amplification.
  - The signal lies in the frequency range from 0-500 Hz and most dominant in between 50-150 Hz

## üîß Working of the Project

<img align=right src="https://github.com/Curovearth/Contactless-with-EMG/blob/main/img/working%20block%20diagram.png" width=500>

- The armband consists of an EMG sensor, wireless signal transmitter and power source.
- It will be worn by the user on his arm where we obtain the signals generated by the biceps/triceps. 
- We set a threshold value for the signal. Once the arm proceeds to perform a certain action that will cause the electric signals generated by the muscles to exceed the threshold limit. 
- This will in  turn cause the EMG sensor to send a response action function which may be auditory or visually.
- Finally, the user will be prompted to avoid any involuntary action that might be harmful.

## Possible Hindrances

- Motion Artifact is caused by the relative movement of the sensor with respect to the underlying skin over the muscle of interest.
- Physiological noise originates from tissues other than muscles that generate electrical signals, such as ECG signal.
- Some portions of the EMG signal may not be from the muscle of interest. Instead, they may result from signals propagated to the sensor from neighbouring muscles. 
- The sensor should be firmly attached to the skin using the double-sided adhesives to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the skin.
